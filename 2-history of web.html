        <h1>History Of Web</h1>



        <h3>Where the Web was born</h3>

        <article>
            Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN. The Web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes
            around the world.
            <br /> CERN is not an isolated laboratory, but rather the focal point for an extensive community that includes more than 17,000 scientists from over 100 countries. <br /> Although they typically spend some time on the CERN site, the scientists
            usually work at universities and national laboratories in their home countries. <br /> Reliable communication tools are therefore essential. The basic idea of the WWW was to merge the evolving technologies of computers, data networks and hypertext
            into a powerful and easy to use global information system

            </figure>

            <br /><br /><br /> Tim Berners-Lee wrote the first proposal for the World Wide Web in March 1989 and his second proposal in May 1990. Together with Belgian systems engineer Robert Cailliau, this was formalised as a management proposal in November
            1990.
            <br /> This outlined the principal concepts and it defined important terms behind the Web. The document described a "hypertext project" called "WorldWideWeb" in which a "web" of "hypertext documents" could be read by “browsers”.
            <br> By the end of 1990, Tim Berners-Lee had the first Web server and browser up and running at CERN, demonstrating his ideas. He developed the code for his Web server on a NeXT computer.
            <br> To prevent i being accidentally switched off, the computer had a hand-written label in red ink:<em> "This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!</em>"

            </figure>

            <br />
            <h3>Web extend</h3>
            Only a few users had access to a NeXT computer platform on which first browser ran, but development soon started on a simpler, ‘line-mode’ browser, which could run on any system . It was writt Nicola Pellow during her student work placement at CERN.In
            1991, Berners-Lee released his WWW software. It included the ‘line-mode’ browser, Web server software and a library for developers. In March 1991, the software became available to colleagues using CERN computer A few months later, in August
            1991, he announced the WWW software on Internet newsgroups and interest in the project spread around the world.

            <br /><br /><br />

            <h3>Going global</h3>
            Thanks to the efforts of Paul Kunz and Louise Addis, the first Web server in the US came online in December 1991, once again in a parti physics laboratory: the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) i California.
            <br> At this stage, there were essentially only two k browser. One was the original development version, which was sophisticated but available only on NeXT machines.
            <br> The other was the ‘line-mode’ browser, which was easy to install and run on any platform but limited in power and user-friendliness.
            <br> It was clear that the s team at CERN could not do all the work needed to develop the syste further, so Berners-Lee launched a plea via the internet f o r other developers to join in.
            <br> Several individuals wrote browsers, mostly for the X-Window System. Notable among these were MIDAS by Tony Johnson SLAC, Viola by Pei Wei from technical publisher O'Reilly Books, and Erwise by Finnish stu d ents from Helsinki University
            of Technology.Earl in 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCS the University of Illinois released a first version of its Mosaic browser.\
            <br> This software ran in the X Window System environment, popular in the research community, and offered friendly window-based interaction.
            <br> Shortly afterwards the NCSA released versions also for th PC and Macintosh environments.
            <br> The existence of reliable user-frie browsers on these popular compu t ers had an immediate impact on th spread of the WWW. The European Commission approved its first web project (WISE) at the end of the same year, with CERN as one of
            the partners.
            <br> On 30 April 1993, CERN made the source code of WorldWideW e 1993 available on a royalty-free basis, making it free software.
            <br> By late 19 there were over 500 known web servers, and the WWW accounted for 1% of internet traffic, which seemed a lot in those days (the rest was r access, e-mail and file trans f er).
            <br> 1994 was the “Year of the Web”. Initiated by Robert Cailliau, the First International World Wide Web conference was held at CERN in May.
            <br> It was attended by 380 users developers, and was hailed as the “Woodstock of the Web”.As 1994 progressed, stories about the Web hit the media. A second conference, attended by 1300 people, was held in the US in October, organise NCSA
            and the newly-formed International WWW Conference Committee (IW3C2).
            <br> By the end of 1994, the Web had 10 000 servers - 2000 of were commercial - and 10 million users.
            <br> Traffic was equivalent to shipping the entire collected works of Shakespeare every second.
            <br> The technology was continually extended to cater for new needs.
            <br> Secu r ity and tools for e-commerce were the most important features soon to be added.

            <br /><br /><br />

            <h3>Open standards</h3>
            An essential point was that the web should remain an open standard for all to use and that no-one should lock it up into a proprietary sy In this spirit, CERN submitted a proposal to the Commission of the European Union under the ESPRIT programme: “WebCore”.
            The goal of the project was to form an international consortium, in collaboration with the US Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 1994, Berne left CERN t o join MIT and founded the International World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
            Meanwhile, with approval of the LHC project clearly i sight, CERN decided that further web development was an activity bey the laboratory’s primary mission. A n e w European partner for W3C was needed.The European Commission turned to the
            French National Instit for Research in Computer Science and Controls (INRIA), to take over CERN's role. In April 1995, INRIA became the first European W3C host, in followed by Keio University of Japan (Shonan Fujisawa Campus) in Asia 1996.
            In 2003, ERCIM (European Research Consortium in Informatics a Mathematics) took over the role of European W3C Host from INRIA. In 2013, W3C announced Beihan g University as the fourth Host. In Septe 2018, there were more than 400 member organisations
            from around the world.

            <h3>What expand the web?</h3>
            1991–1993: The Web goes public, early growth Initial launch In Januar 1991 the first web servers outside CERN were switched on. On 6 Au 1991, Berners-Lee published a short summary of t h e World Wide Web project on the newsgroup alt.
            <br> hypertext, inviting collaborators. Pau Kunz from the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) visited CE September 1991, and was captivated by the Web.
            <br> He brought the NeXT VM/CMS re back to SLAC, where librarian Louise Addis adapted it fo VM/CMS operating system on the IBM mainframe as a way to SPIRES-HEP database and display SLAC's catalog of online documents.This was the first web
            server oi Web had Europe and the first in North America.
            <br> The World Wide Web had several differences from other hypertext systems available at the ti The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it pos s ible for someone to link to another resource without
            action by the owner of that resource.
            <br> It also significantly reduced t difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison t earlier systems), but in turn, presented the chronic problem of link rot.

            <br /><br /><br />

            <h3>Early growth</h3>
            The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy-to-use and flexible format.
            <br> It thus played an important role in popularising use of the Internet. In keeping with its o CERN, early adopters of the Web were primarily university-based scientific departments or physics laboratories.
            <br> By January 1993 there were fifty web servers across the world.By October 1993 there were over five hundred servers online, including some notable websites.
            <br> Follow the introduction of the Web, several media formats based on discrete cosine transform (DCT) were introduced for practical media distribution and streaming over the Web, including the MPEG video format i the JPEG image format in
            1992.
            <br> the MDCT algorithm, led to the development of MP3, which was introduced in 1991 and became the first popular audio format on the Web. The first Microsoft Windows browser was Cello which was released in June 1993.

            <h3>Net Scape</h3>

            <img src="Netscape_Navigator_2_Screenshot.png" alt="netscape" width="700" height="400" />

            <br /><br /><br /> Netscape was the first company to attempt to capitalize on the emerging World Wide Web.[16][17] It was founded under the name Mosaic Communications Corporation on April 4, 1994, the brainchild of Jim Clark who had recruited
            Marc Andreessen as co-founder and Kleiner Perkins as investors.
            <br> The first meeting between Clark and Andreessen was never truly about a software or service like Netscape, but more about a product that was similar to Nintendo.[18] Clark recruited other early team members from SGI and NCSA Mosaic.
            <br> Jim Barksdale came on board as CEO in January 1995.[17] Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen originally created a 20-page concept pitch for an online gaming network to Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 console, but a deal was never reached.
            <br> Marc Andreessen explains, "If they had shipped a year earlier, we probably would have done that instead of Netscape.
            <br> " The company's first product was the web browser, called Mosaic Netscape 0.9, released on October 13, 1994. Within four months of its release, it had already taken three-quarters of the browser market.
            <br> [18] It became the main browser for Internet users in such a short time due to its superiority over other competition, like Mosaic.[18] This browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator, and the company took the "Netscape" name
            (coined by employee Greg Sands,[17] although it was also a trademark of Cisco Systems[20]) on November 14, 1994,[21] to avoid trademark ownership problems with NCSA, where the initial Netscape employees had previously created the NCSA Mosaic
            web browser.
            <br> The Mosaic Netscape web browser did not use any NCSA Mosaic code.[22] The internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for "Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the world's number
            one web browser.
            <br> [23] A cartoon Godzilla-like lizard mascot was drawn by artist-employee Dave Titus,[24] which went well with the theme of crushing the competition. The Mozilla mascot featured prominently on Netscape's website in the company's early years.
            <br> However, the need to project a more "professional" image (especially towards corporate clients) led to this being removed. On August 9, 1995, Netscape made an extremely successful IPO, only sixteen months after the company was formed.
            <br> The stock was set to be offered at US$14 per share, but a last-minute decision doubled the initial offering to US$28 per share.
            <br> The stock's value soared to US$75 during the first day of trading, nearly a record for first-day gain. The stock closed at US$58.25, which gave Netscape a market value of US$2.9 billion.
            <br> While it was somewhat unusual for a company to go public prior to becoming profitable, Netscape's revenues had, in fact, doubled every quarter in 1995.
            <br> The success of this IPO subsequently inspired the use of the term "Netscape moment" to describe a high-visibility IPO that signals the dawn of a new industry.
            <br> [26][27] During this period, Netscape also pursued a publicity strategy (crafted by Rosanne Siino, then head of public relations) packaging Andreessen as the company's "rock star."[28] The events of this period ultimately landed Andreessen,
            barefoot, on the cover of Time magazine.
            <br> [29] The IPO also helped kickstart widespread investment in internet companies that created the dot-com bubble. It is alleged that several Microsoft executives visited the Netscape campus in June 1995 to propose dividing the market (an
            allegation denied by Microsoft and, if true, would have breached antitrust laws), which would have allowed Microsoft to produce web browser software for Windows while leaving all other operating systems to Netscape.
            <br> [31] Netscape refused the proposition. Microsoft released version 1.0 of Internet Explorer as a part of the Windows 95 Plus Pack add-on.
            <br> According to former Spyglass developer Eric Sink, Internet Explorer was based not on NCSA Mosaic as commonly believed, but on a version of Mosaic developed at Spyglass[32] (which itself was based upon NCSA Mosaic).
            <br> This period of time would become known as the browser wars. Netscape Navigator was not free to the general public until January 1998,[33] while Internet Explorer and Internet Information Server have always been free or came bundled with
            an operating system and/or other applications.
            <br> Meanwhile, Netscape faced increasing criticism for "featuritis" – putting a higher priority on adding new features than on making their products work properly.
            <br> Netscape experienced its first bad quarter at the end of 1997 and underwent a large round of layoffs in January 1998.
            <br> Former Netscape executives Mike Homer and Peter Currie have described this period as "hectic and crazy" and that the company was undone by factors both internal and external.
            <br> [34] In January 1998, Netscape started the open source Mozilla project.[35] Netscape publicly released the source code of Netscape Communicator 5.0 under the Netscape Public License, which was similar to the GNU General Public License
            but allowed Netscape to continue to publish proprietary work containing the publicly released code.
            <br> The United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust case against Microsoft in May 1998.
            <br> Netscape was not a plaintiff in the case, though its executives were subpoenaed and it contributed much material to the case, including the entire contents of the 'Bad Attitude' internal discussion forum
